# How to expect a certain failure status of a program.

# Command exits with status 69.
# But the $(O? status) keeps the script from failing.
$(O? status) expect_failure -status 69 -propagate

# Test that the previous command exited with status 69.
# If the status differs, then this command will fail (along with the script).
expect_failure -status 69 -x? $(XF status)
